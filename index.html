          # Prepare as a participant
          
          To learn Drupal frontend development, you need a local development environment with a working Drupal installation.
          
          - You need a (localhost) development environment.
          - Create a Drupal site with the latest stable release of Drupal and the Standard installation profile.
          - Download or clone the [repository of these course materials](https://github.com/OpenDrupal/opendrupal-drupal-frontend). Store it outside of the Drupal directory, e.g. your desktop. It contains exercises and example code.
          
          Next: [Prepare as a trainer](#/2), [Exercises](#/3), [Example code](#/4)

          Each lesson contains exercises. The slides will point you to the right exercise.
          
          Download the repository, and look into the _lesson-1/exercises_ directory for the first exercises. 
                    
          Next: [Example code](#/4)

        <section data-markdown>
          # Example code
          
          Examples of the completed exercises can be found in the _result_ directory of the repository.
          
          Depending on your preferred learning strategy, you can use this to compare your own exercise results with, to read and learn from, or to play with to find out how the code behaves.
