Exercise to learn to use preprocess functions.
Estimated time: 45 min.

==== Exercise 1 ====
Create a separate library to load CSS conditionally.
- Copy the CSS file and opendrupal_agency.theme files from this exercise into
  your theme. The opendrupal_agency.theme file contains stubs for the functions
	your will write in these exercises.
- Create a second library defintion that will only be loaded for logged-in
  users.
- Add agency-authenticated.css to this library.
- Use the function opendrupal_agency_page_attachments_alter() to load the 
  library when the user is logged in. Use the hints below for the PHP code 
	of this function.

---- Hints -----
\Drupal::currentUser()->isAuthenticated()
$attachments['#attached']['library'][]

==== Exercise 2 ====
To reduce the perceived page loading time, move JavaScript files to the end of
the page.
- Use the opendrupal_js_alter() function to modify the loading of JavaScript.
- Search for documentation or examples of hook_js_alter implementations.
- Use the hints below to write the code in opendrupal_js_alter() to move
  JavaScript files to the end of the page.
- Check if the JavaScript still works.

---- Hints ----
- $javascripts[$key]['scope'] = 'footer';

==== Exercise 3 (optional) ====
Add a compatibility mata tag to the html head: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

- Use opendrupal_preprocess_html() to add a meta tag to the Drupal output.
- Search for implementations of hook_preprocess_html in Drupal core.
- Write the code to add the meta tag to the output.
