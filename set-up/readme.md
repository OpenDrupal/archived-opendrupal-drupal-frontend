# Setup as participant
To participate in this course, you need a local development environment with a working Drupal 8 installation.

1. Use the latest stable version of Drupal 8.
2. Copy the installation profile from set-up/opendrupal_agency_profile directory into the profiles directory of your Drupal site.
3. Install Drupal using the OpenDrupal Agency installation profile.
4. Copy the set-up/source-files directory to you development computer. You will use these files as example of the theme you are going to implement into Drupal. 

Download this repository and store it at a convenient place outside of the Drupal root directory. You will use it to read its exercises (included in the _lesson-*_ directories). You will use the files in set-up/source-files as example of the theme you are going to implement into Drupal.

In the _result_ directory you find the completed Drupal theme, the result of the exercises of this course. You may study it as an example of how the theme may be implemented.
